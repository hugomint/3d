3D rendering is the process of creating a realistic or non-realistic photo of basically anything. This helps architects and owners to have a clear view of what will be the possible outcome of their blueprint.

This Process is commonly used in building establishments like houses, skyscrapers, apartments etc., but it can also be used for creating prototypes of cars and other simple objects. As long as the object has a schematic drawing The3DArchitect can turn it into a photo-realistic computer generated image.
