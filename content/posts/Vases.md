Iâ€™m making a tool, that can check a CIDR and see if a domain belongs to one server in the CIDR.
I wanted to do it similar as I do with cUrl, doing the request to the ip address, for example: http://1.2.3.4 and setting the Host Header: example.com

So far the code I have is always returning Status Code 200, but the host exist just in one of the IP I have set. Why is this behavior and how can I get the right behavior from my http request?
