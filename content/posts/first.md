Enviro-foam Qld, is an Australian owned and operated company. The first Enviro-foam factory was opened in 1988 and the Queensland factory has been going strong for over 20 years. The Enviro-foam name and branding was brought about by the way our foam was originally made; being the first company at the time to produce flexible polyurethane foam without the use of fluorocarbons.

Today the Enviro-foam factory produce all their foam in the most environmentally friendly way possible with the exclusive use of Active Seal™ & Super Mix Technologies™. Testing shows below detectable emission levels into the atmosphere from our foam making process. All foam is produced locally on-site at our Clontarf factory on the north side of Brisbane.

The ENVIRO-FOAM Brisbane factory manufacture and produce a full range of Enviro-foam uncovered foam, covered foam mattresses, Pure Sleep Bedding and Kailana No-Spring Mattresses. Proudly an Australian owned business. By purchasing any of these products you are supporting the local community and an Australian company.
